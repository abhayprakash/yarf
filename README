Yet Another Random Forest
=========================

An implementation of the random forests machine learning algorithm in C++.
Currently supports classification only, not fully tested.

Features include:
Class probability distributions at each node (as opposed to just single votes).
OOB error rates.
Feature importance using a permutation test on the OOB samples.

In progress:
Image segmentation/classification, currently some Haar-like features are available.

Aims:
Configurable split rules (currently only one: single feature threshold scored using information gain).
